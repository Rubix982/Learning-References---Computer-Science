- [Java Applets for Machine Learning](https://cgl.ethz.ch/teaching/former/vc_master_06/applets.html): Info about perceptron, k-means, SVM with Linear Kernel, Multi Class SVM
- [A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/files/105-machine-learning-paper.pdf) by Gunnar Ratsch
- [CS229 Machine Learning - Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) - This is the Stanford CS course on Machine Learning that Prof Ng has taught for a number of years. The material parallels the Coursera course, but covers some additional topics and goes into much more depth on the mathematics.
- [Dive into Machine Learning](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) compiles a variety of resources, taking a hack-first approach so you can get "hooked." Prof. Ng's course is the centerpiece.
- [Cornell Virtual Workshop Training](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/default) on programming languages, parallel computing, code improvement, and data analysis.
