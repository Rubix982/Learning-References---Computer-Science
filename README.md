# Learning-References---Computer-Science

- This repo is about adding links and article, whatever, related to each and different branches of Computer Science as a way to quickly pick up materials for research, development, and see what options are available when tasked with a problem.

- I made this so I can quickly just get a link to whatever thing I'm talking about and I don't have to go hunting around for it on the Internet.

- I've seen many github repos specifically targeted for a specfic field ( data science, web, etc ), but this list is supposed to be general for `Computer Science` and `Software Engineering` as a whole.

# TODO

- Add all relevant links from [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/NrY2G).
